To be more precise, they are very, _very_ different from anything you have seen. Embark on this journey with an open mind...\n",

It dictates that the programmer must spoonfeed the machine exactly how to change its state. But functional programming languages rely on a different style dubbed the declarative programming **paradigm**. So, newcommers to functional programming should now prepare for a paradigm shift. Veterans may move on to the next section.\n",
